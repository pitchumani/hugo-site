I felt writing a webpage is easy when compare to other programming. But making
the website beautiful, appealing, responsive to different devices are not for
everyone. It is best to leave that hard work to the experts. There are many web
application frameworks (ReactJS, Vue.js) that makes website development easier.
To design webpages, there are many CSS frameworks such as bootstrap, tailwind.
They provide predefined properties that we can use to make our webpage design
easy.

This seems good for web developers. What about others who wish to write some
content but not write web pages. They can use static site generators such as
hugo, Jekyll, VuePress etc.
