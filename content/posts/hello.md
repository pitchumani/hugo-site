Hello World!

This is my first post in this site. As seen in the footer of the web,
this site is built using hugo (coder theme).

**Generating content**

I wished to develop my personal website on my own. But I felt it was
overwhelming to design and customize the pages in everchanging web
developments. So, I chose to use static site generators with themes.
I liked Hugo and its themes. I referred few articles to get started
with hugo to generate this static site. Hugo's
[quick-start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)
and instructions in the themes page was useful.

**Publishing the website**

Publishing this site using github [pages](https://pages.github.com/).
