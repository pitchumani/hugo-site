Hello World!

This is my first post in this site.

I wished to create my personal website on my own. Not to write and share
with the world, but to have experience of writing website on my own. I wrote
basic html pages, and used web frameworks like bootstrap, vue.js etc for some 
time. I lost the minimal touch I had on web development and lost all my previous
content with my virtual machine I had in Google cloud.

This time, I wish to start with static site generators to create website and
spend more time in writing content. I hope to write more content in this website
as blog posts.
